				<h1>about me & my interests</h1>
				<h2>whoami</h2>
				<p>I'm Bean, an 18 year old British person. I am a programmer and
				mathematician. I really enjoy both of these subjects because of their
				logical and structured nature. I'm planning on doing a degree in
				Mathematics & Computer Science at university.</p>
				<h2>interests</h2>
				<h3>computers</h3>
				<p>As stated above, I am very interested my computers and programming.
				After learning some basic programming I did an A Level in computer science.
				It was during this time that I started to become very interested in
				Linux. I had never really tried it out properly, and I had only heard
				a few things about it, such as that it was better for programmers but
				very bad for gaming. It was a combination of the former and learning of
				dual booting that enticed me to try it out, installing Linux Mint onto
				a partition on my laptop.</p>
				<p>At first I failed to see what was special
				about it, only really using the tools that were supplied with the
				distro. However, the longer time went on, the better of a fit it felt.
				Learning to use the terminal made my work much faster, and Valve's
				development of Proton let me leave my worries about game compatability
				behind.</p>
				<p>Now I am an avid Linux fan, using Arch Linux on my computer daily,
				also being a big fan of FOSS, which my Linux experience taught me the
				value of.</p>
				<h3>games</h3>
				<h4>tabletop rpgs</h4>
				<p>I've been playing 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons for many years
				now. I have a great interest in the game because I really enjoy
				creating characters and dungeons, as well as optimising my characters
				to be as efficient as possible.</p>
				<p>I've wanted to try other tabletop RPG systems for a while: particularly
				Call of Cthulhu, Lancer and Pathfinder. I just haven't got around to it
				due to lack of interest from my friends. Maybe I'll do it when I go to
				university in September.</p>
				<h4>video games</h4>
				<p>I'm a fan of a few video games from varying genres. I have my Steam
				linked on the links sub-page if you'd like to add me and play anything!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Guilty Gear</li>
					<li>Terraria</li>
					<li>Fire Emblem</li>
					<li>Minecraft</li>
					<li>Kirby</li>
					<li>Mario</li>
					<li>Starbound</li>
					<li>Stardew Valley</li>
					<li>League of Legends</li>
					<li>Overwatch</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>baking</h3>
				<p>I also really enjoy baking! It's a fun challenge of technique that
				nets you something delicious at the end. What's not to love?</p>
				<p>I might expand this website at some point to include any recipes
				I want to share.</p>
