		`Good afternoon, dear visitor. Welcome to my little corner of the
		internet. After a recent restructure of the site I will now be writing
		miscellany on this page. "Why?", I hear you ask. Because I feel like
		it, that is why. Reasons aside, you can expect more ramblings to
		appear on this page over time. See you then!`

		`After a long while of thinnking of something other than this website to
		make, I was finally struck with inspiration this morning! After looking
		into things, it turns out that Xiaomi's Yeelights (the smart lights I
		have) have a Python API, so I spent most of today programming a TUI
		program to control my smart lights. If you'd like to see more about
		them, check out my <a href='stuff.html'>stuff page</a> for more info,
		including source code!`

		`Splatoon 3 looks really cool! I sitll don't have it yet but I have
		been listening to the soundtrack quite a bit and it is as wonderful as
		I have come to expect Splatoon's music to be. I did play the demo,
		which was very fun. I enjoyed the NZap for its Tacticooler, which was
		very useful in coordinated play with my friends.`

		`<img src="src/img/stuff/monitor.png">Before going to university I
		have invested in an ultrawide monitor to connect to my laptop, and oh
		my goodness was that a good chocie! The increase in space is so
		wonderful. I have particularly enjoyed maintaining my website since I
		now have the space for two editors to be open alongside a windows of
		the actual website. Additionally, the USB ports on the back of it are
		super useful for lessening the mess of cable management.`

		"Filesystem organisation", "üìÇ", "11 Sep 2022",
		`After talking to a friend about it today, I've given my computer's
		filesystem a good reorganisation. Before it was cluttered, which made
		it hard to naviagte, especially via a command line, but after a few
		changes I am already becoming much more efficient. The first change I
		made was renaming folders in the root of my home directory to something
		short and simple. For example, "Documents" became simply "docs". All
		names were 4 letters which mean they were all in a standard format. The
		second change was numbering important subdirectories so that they
		appear in a good order, as well as making it easier to move into them
		using the cd command and tab completion. Doing these two things has
		made my life a lot easier!`
