		`Good afternoon, dear visitor. Welcome to my little corner of the
		internet. After a recent restructure of the site I will now be writing
		miscellany on this page. "Why?", I hear you ask. Because I feel like
		it, that is why. Reasons aside, you can expect more ramblings to
		appear on this page over time. See you then!`

		`After a long while of thinnking of something other than this website to
		make, I was finally struck with inspiration this morning! After looking
		into things, it turns out that Xiaomi's Yeelights (the smart lights I
		have) have a Python API, so I spent most of today programming a TUI
		program to control my smart lights. If you'd like to see more about
		them, check out my <a href='stuff.html'>stuff page</a> for more info,
		including source code!`

		been listening to the soundtrack quite a bit and it is as wonderful as
		I have come to expect Splatoon's music to be. I did play the demo,
		which was very fun. I enjoyed the NZap for its Tacticooler, which was
		very useful in coordinated play with my friends.`

		have invested in an ultrawide monitor to connect to my laptop, and oh
		my goodness was that a good chocie! The increase in space is so
		wonderful. I have particularly enjoyed maintaining my website since I
		now have the space for two editors to be open alongside a windows of
		the actual website. Additionally, the USB ports on the back of it are
		super useful for lessening the mess of cable management.`
