		`I'm starting things off with my absolute favourite song,
		being Faust's theme from GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-. This song
		definitely sounds like it was written by a crazy person.
		This song's my favourite of all time, and for good reason.`
	],
	[
		"Weird Science", "Dead Man's Party", "29/08/2022",
		`This song is very funny. I like how whimsical it is.
		Expect to see other songs from the album Dead Man's Party,
		because they're all cracking.`
	],
	[
		"Zero Stage 2", "Mega Man X5", "30/08/2022",
		`I enjoy this song very much. The synth is wonderful and I
		also like the piano, and the clicks are also simply
		wonderful. As to be expected of the Meagaman X series.`
	],
	[
		"TSUKI NO SHIHAI", "GUILTY GEAR Xrd -REVELATOR-", "31/08/2022",
		`This is probably my favourite song from Guilty Gear Xrd,
		tied with Destructive Goodwill (expect to see that song
		appear soon). I'm a really really big fan of Raven:
		he's probably my third favourite character in the series,
		after Faust and Testament. Hopefully we'll see him in
		Guilty Gear -STRIVE- one day as a DLC character. I can only
		hope. Anyways, I'm glad they decided to do lyrical songs
		for the Revelator character themes because this one's just
		cracking.`
	],
	[
		"Touch-Tone Telephone", "Spirit Phone", "01/09/2022",
		`I like this song for reasons similar to Weird Science. The
		lyrics are very funny and the song overall just appeals to
		me due to this. I'm not quite sure how to explain why I
		like it, I just do.`
	],
	[
		"Wasteland", "Terraria Calamity Mod", "02/09/2022",
		`This song is very relaxing. It also manages to stay
		impressively faithful to Terraria's original soundtrack,
		what with the heavy reliance on synthesized beep boops. I
		very much enjoy it.`
	],
	[
		"Cats on Mars", "Cowboy Bebop OST 2: No Disc", "03/09/2022",
		`This song appeals to me for how silly it is, what with the
		gibberish "lyrics" and the funny beeps and boops. It also
		reminds me of Edward who is easily my favourite character
		from Cowboy Bebop. This song is very much befitting of
		them.`
	],
	[
		"The Alchemist's Haven", "Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows", "04/09/2022",
		`This song is so very mischeivous sounding. It is
		incredibly befitting of Plague Knight, who is
		absolutely one of my favourite Shovel Knight
		characters, so I'm sort of obligated to like this
		theme.`
	],
	[
		"Death By Galmour", "UNDERTALE", "05/09/2022",
		`This is defiitely my favourite song from UNDERTALE. It's
		just so groovy. Mettaton is an excellent character which is
		why I'm glad they got such a cracking battle theme. This
		song and BIG SHOT from DELTARUNE make me wish there was a
		full length version of Power of NEO, but oh well.`
	],
	[
		"Destructive Goodwill", "GUILTY GEAR Xrd -SIGN-", "06/09/2022",
		`I am a massive fan of this song. It fits Faust so
		perfectly, what with the swapping between the more serious
		guitar sections and the silly piano sections. This one is
		very good.`
	],
	[
		"hello world", "Louie Zong", "07/09/2022",
		`Funny text to speech singing and a good melody. I need no
		more reason to like a song.`
	],
	[
		"Id (Purpose)", "Fire Emblem Awakening", "08/09/2022",
		`This song is absolutely fabulous. You can tell that they
		went all out, because this is absolutely the best final map
		theme from the Fire Emblem series. Which makes sense, since
		this was meant to be the last game in the series. Fire
		Emblem Awakening is a game that is very important to me,
		which is why I have a very strong attachment to this song.`
	],
	[
		"Far Dawn", "Fire Emblem Fates", "09/09/2022",
		`After listening to the Fire Emblem Awakening OST yesterday
		I felt somewhat obligated to revisit Fire Emblem Fates too
		today. Far Dawn is my favourite song quite easily. I heard
		this song a lot from it playing in the castle hub that the
		game has, so this evokes some rather nostalgic memories.`
	],
	[
		"Paintscraper", "Splatune 3", "10/09/2022",
		`This is probably my favourite of the Splatoon 3 songs I've listened
		to. The guitar bit at the start is so good, and the classic
		nonsensical lyrics are as good as ever. They did another great job
		with this game's soundtrack.`
	],
	[
		"calm4.ogg", "Minecraft Volume Alpha", "11/09/2022",
		`I really love this song. To me it is one of the most Minecrafty
		Minecraft songs, which is odd considering this is one of the ones
		removed in the game's alpha! It's a real shame they cut this track.
		Granted, "calm" isn't exactly how I'd describe it, but if that's the
		reason it got cut then they would've just renamed it. I will forever
		ponder the removal of this song. Also, this song is added to the
		playlist as "Magnetic Circuit", which is the title Notch rereleased
		the song under on his SoundCloud page. It's a much more befitting
		name, I think.`

	[
		"Like A Weed, Naturally, As A Matter Of Course", "GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-", "12/09/2022",
		`I wanted to try for as long as I could before putting multiple songs
		from one album into the playlist. If I didn't this would probably have
		been the second song I put on it. Testament is definitely my second
		favourite character from Guilty Gear and I was so hyped when they
		revealed they would be returning in GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- after so many
		years. I have another friend who really likes Testament and we just
		went absolutely crazy on that day. Their redesign was simply fabulous
		(massive bonus points for the presence of a top hat) and it was also
		really coold for them to be canonically non-binary. And you top all
		that off with a killer song like this that does a cracking job of
		sounding like Testament (the band that the character was named after)?
		Why, that's a recipe for a grand return indeed!`,

		"Electric Crown", "The Ritual", "13/09/2022",

		see what kind of songs they produced. I enjoyed them very much, but
		this one is my favourite.`

	[
		"Greenleaf", "Pokemon Conquest", "14/09/2022",
		`This song is so very relaxing. I really love the music of Pokemon
		Conquest, but nothing tops Greenleaf. It really hits me with a lot of
		nostalgia.`

	[
		"Sand Canyon 1", "Kirby's Dreamland 3", "15/09/2022",
		`A very fun and whimsical song, as is most of the Kirby's Dreamland 3
		soundtrack. This song has been premanently burned into my brain
		because of <a href="https://youtu.be/ixDpndpzh_4">this SiIvaGunner
		rip</a>.`

	[
		"Perfume", "Sessions: Star Guardian Taliyah", "16/09/2022",
		`I'm a really big fan of most of this album (as well as the other ones
		amde by Riot Games Music), but Perfume is definitely my favourite. I'm
		a big fan of the high energy, and especially the fun twinkly sounds it
		uses.`
	],
	[
		"Keep In Gates", "GUILTY GEAR XX Accent Core +R", "17/09/2022",
		`More Guitly Gear music? Of course! I really like this song's
		spooky vibe combined with it just being good metal music. I don't
		really have much else to say. It's just a good song. Oh, and ABA is a
		great character! I was really pleased to see that she was actually
		quite popular int he recent character popularity polls. I dearly hope
		she returns ing GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE-! Though, to be honest, I would
		definitely rather see Raven again, but that won't happen. To the 3
		other Raven fans, tonight we weep...`

	[
		"Trap Phantasm", "Mega Man ZX Advent", "18/09/2022",
		`Though Mega Man ZX Advent was somewhat lacking, I do think it has
		quite a good soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, it's not on the same level
		as Mega Man Zero, but it's good. Except for this song, which is just
		wonderful (and so is Trap Factory)! Really good synth,a s one should
		expect from a Mega Man song, but with also really good guitar. Quite
		simply cracking!`

		"Icosa", "Oliver Buckland", "19/09/2022",
		`<a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhPaJURyApsoMQDaoft5t0l0iAwUOLtlM'>E-NA</a>
		is such a wonderful series of animations, and if you haven't seen the
		videos in the series then you simply must. One thing I did not expect
		from it, though, was such a cracking soundtrack. This song has such an
		air of whimsy to it that is really quite wonderful. It was quite hard
		to choose whether to pick this or Hourglass Meadow. I anticipate I will
		end up adding the latter eventually.`
