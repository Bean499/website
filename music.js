		being Faust's theme from Guilty Gear -STRIVE-. This song
		definitely sounds like it was written by a crazy person.
		This song's my favourite of all time, and for good reason.`

		Expect to see other songs from the album Dead Man's Party,

		also like the piano, and the clicks are also simply
		wonderful. As to be expected of the Meagaman X series.`

		"TSUKI NO SHIHAI", "31/08/2022",
		`This is probably my favourite song from Guilty Gear Xrd,
		tied with Destructive Goodwill (expect to see that song
		appear soon). I'm a really really big fan of Raven:
		he's probably my third favourite character in the series,
		after Faust and Testament. Hopefully we'll see him in
		Guilty Gear -STRIVE- one day as a DLC character. I can only
		hope. Anyways, I'm glad they decided to do lyrical songs
		for the Revelator character themes because this one's just
		cracking.`
